# Emulator Monitor

Emulator Monitor is a local development dashboard for Azure Service Bus and AWS
SQS. It combines a React monitor, a NestJS API, MongoDB-backed message tracking,
and containerized messaging emulators in one Nx workspace.

## Workspace

| Project | Purpose | Main technology |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `apps/monitor` | Browser dashboard | React 19, Vite, TanStack Query |
| `apps/backend` | Versioned API and background message workers | NestJS 11, Mongoose |
| `apps/monitor-e2e` | Browser smoke tests | Playwright |
| `libs/shared/entities` | Browser-safe shared message types | TypeScript |

The Azure Service Bus entities are defined in
[`config/servicebus-config.json`](config/servicebus-config.json). The SQS worker
creates its configured queue when it first connects to LocalStack.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 22 (the version is recorded in `.nvmrc`)
- Yarn Classic 1.22
- Docker with Docker Compose v2

## Start locally

```bash
nvm use
yarn install --frozen-lockfile
yarn compose:up
yarn dev
```

The local defaults work without an environment file. Copy `.env.example` to
`.env` before starting the backend when you need to override them.

| Service | Address |
| --- | --- |
| Monitor | <http://localhost:4200> |
| API | <http://localhost:3000/api/v1> |
| Azure Service Bus emulator | `localhost:5672` (AMQP), `localhost:5300` |
| LocalStack SQS | <http://localhost:4566> |
| MongoDB | `mongodb://localhost:27017` |

SQL Server and Azurite support the Service Bus emulator inside the Compose
network and are not exposed to the host. All exposed development ports bind to
`127.0.0.1` only.

Stop the emulators with:

```bash
yarn compose:down
```

## Commands

| Command | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `yarn dev` | Start the backend and monitor together |
| `yarn dev:backend` | Start only the NestJS API |
| `yarn dev:monitor` | Start only the Vite monitor |
| `yarn build` | Build every buildable Nx project |
| `yarn test` | Run all unit tests |
| `yarn test:backend` | Run backend Jest tests |
| `yarn test:monitor` | Run monitor Vitest tests |
| `yarn test:e2e` | Run the Chromium Playwright smoke suite |
| `yarn lint` | Lint all projects |
| `yarn typecheck` | Type-check all projects |
| `yarn verify` | Run lint, type-check, unit tests, and builds |
| `yarn compose:up` | Start the local dependencies in the background |
| `yarn compose:down` | Stop the local dependencies |

The Playwright target starts the monitor automatically and mocks its tracked
messages request, so it does not require the backend or Docker. Install its
browser once on a new machine:

```bash
yarn playwright install chromium
```

## Configuration

Backend configuration is loaded from the process environment and root `.env`
file. Important settings are:

| Variable | Local default |
| --- | --- |
| `PORT` | `3000` |
| `CORS_ORIGIN` | `http://localhost:4200` |
| `SERVICE_BUS_CONNECTION_STRING` | Service Bus emulator connection |
| `SERVICE_BUS_NAMESPACE` | `sbemulatorns` |
| `SERVICE_BUS_QUEUE` | `orders-queue` |
| `MONGO_URI` | `mongodb://testuser:testpass@localhost:27017/` |
| `MONGO_MESSAGE_DB` | `MessageTrackingDb` |
| `MONGO_AUTH_SOURCE` | `admin` |
| `AWS_SQS_ENDPOINT` | `http://localhost:4566` |
| `AWS_REGION` | `us-east-1` |
| `AWS_SQS_QUEUE_NAME` | `orders-queue` |
| `THROTTLE_TTL` / `THROTTLE_LIMIT` | `60` / `60` |

To point the browser at another API, create `apps/monitor/.env.local`:

```dotenv
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000/api/v1
```

The credentials in `.env.example` and `docker-compose.yml` are emulator-only
values. Use managed secrets and real credentials outside local development.

## Health checks

The API uses the global `/api/v1` prefix:

- `GET /api/v1/health/live` reports process liveness without checking dependencies.
- `GET /api/v1/health/ready` checks MongoDB, Azure Service Bus, and SQS.
- `GET /api/v1/health` is an alias for the readiness check.

A readiness response can remain unhealthy for a short time while the containers
finish starting. Inspect them with `docker compose ps` and
`docker compose logs <service>`.

## API areas

- `/api/v1/service-bus` sends, receives, lists, and configures Service Bus messages.
- `/api/v1/aws-sqs` sends, receives, lists, and configures SQS messages.
- `/api/v1/tracked-messages/tracking` manages unified message tracking.
- `/api/v1/message-resources/resources` manages saved messaging resources.

Request DTOs are validated globally; unknown fields are rejected.

## Local data

Compose stores MongoDB, SQL Server, Azurite, and LocalStack state in named
volumes. To completely reset local emulator data, stop the application and run:

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

This permanently removes the local Compose volumes. If an external MongoDB was
created with an older project version, check for the legacy unique
`messageId_1` index before reusing the same message ID across providers. Current
tracking uniqueness is scoped by `emulatorType` and `messageId`.
